Research Direction and Question

Our group aims to explore the factors that most strongly influence salary variation among data developers. The central research question is:

“How do experience level, remote work ratio, geography, and company size affect the salary (in USD) of data developers?”

We will apply exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling to:

Identify trends across different regions and roles.

Compare compensation by experience level and employment type.

Estimate which employment attributes most significantly predict salary.
